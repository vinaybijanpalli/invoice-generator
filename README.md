An Invoice creator project built with React. Add itemized items, configure quantity, prices, tax rates and discounts. Download Invoice as PDFs to your device. Uses [jspdf-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jspdf-react) to capture the data from the modal and covert it from canvas -> pdf.

Added redux to store the created invoices, display a list of these invoices, and provided options to view, edit, clone and delete them.
